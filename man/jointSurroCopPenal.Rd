\if{html}{\bold{Joint Frailty-Copula model for Surrogacy definition}

Fit the one-step Joint frailty-copula surrogate model for the evaluation of a canditate surrogate endpoint,
with different integration methods on the random effects, using a semiparametric penalized
likelihood estimation. This approach extends that of Burzykowski \code{et al.} (2001) by
including in the bivariate copula model the random effects treatment-by-trial interaction.

Assume S\out{<sub>ij</sub>} and \out{T<sub>ij</sub>} the failure times associated respectively
with the surrogate and the true endpoints, for subject \code{j(j = 1,..., n}\out{<sub>i</sub>}\code{)} belonging to
the trial \code{i (i = 1,..., G)}.

Let \out{<strong>v</strong>}\out{<sub>i</sub>} = (u\out{<sub>i</sub>},
v\out{<sub>S<sub>i</sub></sub>}, v\out{<sub>T<sub>i</sub></sub>}) be the vector of trial
level random effects; \out{<b>Z</b><sub>S,ij</sub> = (Z<sub>Sij1</sub>, ..., Z<sub>Sijp</sub>)<sup>'</sup>}
and \out{<b>Z</b><sub>T,ij</sub> = (Z<sub>Tij1</sub>, ..., Z<sub>Tijp</sub>)<sup>'</sup>}
be covariates associated with \out{S<sub>ij</sub>} and \out{T<sub>ij</sub>}.
The joint frailty-copula model is defined as follows:

{\figure{jointSurvCop1.png}{options: width="100\%"}}

where

{\figure{jointSurvCop3.png}{options: width="100\%"}}

and the conditional survival functions are given by

{\figure{jointSurvCop2.png}{options: width="100\%"}}

in which

u\out{<sub>i</sub>} \out{&#126;} \eqn{N}(0,\eqn{\gamma}),
u\out{<sub>i</sub>} \out{&#8869;} v\out{<sub>S<sub>i</sub></sub>}, u\out{<sub>i</sub>} \out{&#8869;} v\out{<sub>T<sub>i</sub></sub>};
(v\out{<sub>S<sub>i</sub></sub>}, v\out{<sub>T<sub>i</sub></sub>})\out{<sup>T</sup>} \out{&#126;} \eqn{N}(0,\eqn{\Sigma}\out{<sub>v</sub>})

with

{\figure{surromodel2.png}{options: width="100\%"}}


In this model, \eqn{\lambda}\out{<sub>0s</sub>}(x) is the baseline hazard function associated with the
surrogate endpoint and \eqn{\beta}\out{<sub>S</sub>} the fixed effects (or log-hazard ratio) corresponding
to the covariates \out{<b>Z</b><sub>S,ij</sub>};
\eqn{\lambda}\out{<sub>0T</sub>}(x) is the baseline hazard function associated with the true endpoint
and \eqn{\beta}\out{<sub>T</sub>} the fixed treatment effects corresponding
to the covariates \out{<b>Z</b><sub>T,ij</sub>}. The copula model serves to consider dependence between
the surrogate and true endpoints at the individual level. In the copula model, \eqn{\theta} is the copula
parameter used to quantify the strength of association. u\out{<sub>i</sub>} is a shared frailty effect associated
with the baseline hazard function that serve to take into account the heterogeneity between trials
of the baseline hazard function, associated with the fact that we have several trials in this
meta-analytical design. The power parameter \eqn{\alpha} distinguishes
trial-level heterogeneity between the surrogate and the true endpoint.
v\out{<sub>S<sub>i</sub></sub>} and v\out{<sub>T<sub>i</sub></sub>} are two correlated random effects treatment-by-trial interactions.
\eqn{Z}\out{<sub>Sij1</sub>} or \eqn{Z}\out{<sub>Tij1</sub>} represents the treatment arm to which the patient has been randomized.

For simplicity, we focus on the Clayton and Gumbel-Hougaard copula functions. In Clayton's
model, the copula function has the form

{\figure{jointSurvCop5.png}{options: width="100\%"}}

and in Gumbel's model, the copula function has the form

{\figure{jointSurvCop6.png}{options: width="100\%"}}


\bold{Surrogacy evaluation}

We propose to base validation of a candidate surrogate endpoint on Kendall's \eqn{\tau} at the individual level and
coefficient of determination at the trial level, as in the classical approach (Burzykowski \code{et al.}, 2001).
The formulations are given below.

\bold{Individual-level surrogacy}

From the proposed model, according to the copula function, it can be shown that Kendall's \eqn{\tau}
is defined as :

{\figure{jointSurvCop4.png}{options: width="100\%"}}


 where \eqn{\theta} is the copula parameter. Kendall's \eqn{\tau} is the difference between the probability of
 concordance and the probability of discordance of two realizations of \eqn{S}\out{<sub>ij</sub>} and \eqn{T}\out{<sub>ij</sub>}.
 It belongs to the interval [-1,1] and assumes a zero value when \eqn{S}\out{<sub>ij</sub>} and \eqn{T}\out{<sub>ij</sub>} are
 independent.

 \bold{Trial-level surrogacy}

 The key motivation for validating a surrogate endpoint is to be able to predict the effect
 of treatment on the true endpoint, based on the observed effect of treatment on the
 surrogate endpoint. As shown by Buyse \emph{et al.} (2000), the coefficenient of
 determination obtains from the covariance matrix \eqn{\Sigma}\out{<sub>v</sub>} of the random effects
 treatment-by-trial interaction can be used to evaluate underlined prediction, and
 therefore as surrogacy evaluation measurement at trial-level. It is defined by:

 {\figure{surromodel4.png}{options: width="100\%"}}

 The SEs of \eqn{R}\out{<sub>trial</sub>}\out{<sup>2</sup>} and \eqn{\tau} are calculated using the Delta-method. We also propose
 \eqn{R}\out{<sub>trial</sub>}\out{<sup>2</sup>} and 95\% CI computed using the parametric bootstrap. The use of delta-method
 can lead to confidence limits violating the [0,1], as noted by
 (Burzykowski \emph{et al.}, 2001). However, using other methods would not significantly alter
 the findings of the surrogacy assessment

Fit the one-step Joint surrogate model for the evaluation of a canditate surrogate endpoint,
with different integration methods on the random effects, using a semiparametric penalized
likelihood estimation. This approach extends that of Burzykowski \code{et al.} (2001) by
including in the bivariate copula model the random effects treatment-by-trial interaction.

Assume \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} the failure times associated respectively
with the surrogate and the true endpoints, for subject \code{j} (\eqn{j=1,\ldots, n_i})
belonging to the trial \eqn{i (i=1, \ldots, G)}.

Let \eqn{\mathbf{v}_i = (u_i,v_{Si},v_{Ti})} be the vector of trial
level random effects; \eqn{\mathbf{Z}_{S,ij} = (Z_{Sij1}, \cdots, Z_{Sijp})^{'}} and
\eqn{\mathbf{Z}_{T,ij} = (Z_{Tij1}, \cdots, Z_{Tijp})^{'}}
be covariates associated with \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}}
The joint frailty-copula model is defined as follows:


\deqn{\begin{array}{ll}

  = P(S_{ij} > s_{ij}, T_{ij} > t_{ij}|\mathbf{Z}_{S,ij}, \mathbf{Z}_{T,ij},\mathbf{v}_i) \\
  & = \varphi_\theta [\varphi^{-1}_\theta(\bar{F}(s_{ij}|\mathbf{Z}_{S,ij},u_i, v_{Si}))
  +  \varphi^{-1}_\theta(\bar{F}(t_{ij}|\mathbf{Z}_{T,ij},u_i, v_{Ti}))]\\
\end{array} }

where,

\eqn{\varphi_\theta} : \eqn{[0,\infty) \rightarrow [0, 1]} the generator of a parametric
Archimedean copula family

and the conditional survival functions are given by

\deqn{\bar{F}_{S,ij}(s_{ij}|\mathbf{Z}_{S,ij},u_i, v_{Si})= \exp \bigg\{ - \int_0^{s_{ij}} \lambda _{0S}(x)

                 \right)}

In this model, \eqn{\lambda_{0S}(t)} is the baseline hazard function associated with the
surrogate endpoint and \eqn{\beta_S} the fixed effects (or log-hazard ratio) corresponding
to the covariates \eqn{\mathbf{Z}_{S,ij}};
\eqn{\lambda_{0T}(t)} is the baseline hazard function associated with the true endpoint
and \eqn{\beta_T} the fixed effects corresponding to the covariates \eqn{\mathbf{Z}_{T,ij}}.
The copula model serves to consider dependence between
the surrogate and true endpoints at the individual level. In the copula model, \eqn{\theta} is the copula
parameter used to quantify the strength of association. \eqn{u_i} is a shared frailty effect associated
with the baseline hazard function that serve to take into account the heterogeneity between trials
of the baseline hazard function, associated with the fact that we have several trials in this
meta-analytical design. The power parameter \eqn{\alpha} distinguishes
trial-level heterogeneity between the surrogate and the true endpoint.
\eqn{v_{S_i}} and \eqn{v_{T_i}} are two correlated random effects treatment-by-trial interactions.
\eqn{Z_{Sij1}} or \eqn{Z_{Tij1}} represents the treatment arm to which the patient has been randomized.

For simplicity, we focus on the Clayton and Gumbel-Hougaard copula functions. In Clayton's
model, the copula function has the form

\deqn{\varphi_\theta(s) = (1 + \theta s)^{-1/\theta}, \hspace{0.25cm} \theta > 0}

and in Gumbel's model, the copula function has the form

\deqn{\varphi_\theta(s) = \exp{[-s^{1/(1+\theta)}]}, \hspace{0.25cm} \theta \geq 0}

\bold{Surrogacy evaluation}

We proposed to base validation of a candidate surrogate endpoint on Kendall's \eqn{\tau} at the individual level and
coefficient of determination at the trial level, as in the classical approach (Burzykowski \code{et al.}, 2001).
The formulations are given below.

\bold{Individual-level surrogacy}

From the proposed model, according to the copula function, it can be shown that Kendall's \eqn{\tau}
is defined as:

\eqn{\tau = \frac{\theta}{\theta + 2}} for Clayton copula and \eqn{\tau = \frac{\theta}{\theta + 1}}
for Gumbel copula.


 where \eqn{\theta} is the copula parameter. Kendall's \eqn{\tau} is the difference between the probability of
 concordance and the probability of discordance of two realizations of \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}}.
 It belongs to the interval [-1,1] and assumes a zero value when \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are
 independent.

 \bold{Trial-level surrogacy}

 The key motivation for validating a surrogate endpoint is to be able to predict the effect
 of treatment on the true endpoint, based on the observed effect of treatment on the
 surrogate endpoint. As shown by Buyse \emph{et al.} (2000), the coefficenient of
 determination obtains from the covariance matrix \eqn{\Sigma_v} of the random effects
 treatment-by-trial interaction can be used to evaluate underlined prediction, and
 therefore as surrogacy evaluation measurement at trial-level. It is defined by:

 \deqn{ R^2_{trial}=\frac{\sigma^2_{v_{ST}}}{\sigma^2_{v_S}\sigma^2_{v_T}}
 }

 The SEs of \eqn{R^2_{trial}} and \eqn{\tau} are calculated using the Delta-method. We also propose
 \eqn{R^2_{trial}} and 95\% CI computed using the parametric bootstrap. The use of delta-method
 can lead to confidence limits violating the [0,1], as noted by
 (Burzykowski \emph{et al.}, 2001). However, using other methods would not significantly alter
 the findings of the surrogacy assessment

{
The estimated parameter are obtained using the robust Marquardt algorithm
(Marquardt, 1963) which is a combination between a Newton-Raphson algorithm
and a steepest descent algorithm. The iterations are stopped when the
difference between two consecutive log-likelihoods was small (<
\if{html}{10\out{<sup>-3</sup>}} \if{latex}{\eqn{10^{-3}}}), the estimated
coefficients were stable (consecutive
values (< \if{html}{10\out{<sup>-3</sup>}} \if{latex}{\eqn{10^{-3}}})), and the gradient
small enough (< \if{html}{10\out{<sup>-3</sup>}} \if{latex}{\eqn{10^{-3}}}), by default.
Cubic M-splines of order 4 are used for the hazard function, and I-splines
(integrated M-splines) are used for the cumulative hazard function.

The inverse of the Hessian matrix is the variance estimator and to deal
with the positivity constraint of the variance component and the spline
coefficients, a squared transformation is used and the standard errors are
computed by the \eqn{\Delta}-method (Knight & Xekalaki, 2000). The smooth
parameter can be chosen by maximizing a likelihood cross validation
criterion (Joly and other, 1998).

We proposed based on the joint surrogate model a new definition
of the Kendall's \eqn{\tau}. Moreover, distinct numerical integration methods are available to approximate the
integrals in the marginal log-likelihood.

\bold{Non-convergence case management procedure}

Special attention must be given to initializing model parameters, the choice of the number of
spline knots, the smoothing parameters and the number of quadrature points to solve convergence
issues. We first initialized parameters using the user's desired strategy, as specified
by the option \code{true.init.val}. When numerical or convergence problems are encountered,
with \code{kappa.use} set to \code{4}, the model is fitted again using a combination of the following strategies:
vary the number of quadrature point (\code{nb.gh} to \code{nb.gh2} or \code{nb.gh2} to \code{nb.gh})
in the event of the use of the Gaussian Hermite quadrature integration (see \code{int.method});
divided or multiplied the smoothing parameters (\if{latex}{\code{k_1}} \if{html}{k\out{<sub>1</sub>}},
\if{latex}{\code{k_2}} \if{html}{k\out{<sub>2</sub>}}) by 10 or 100 according to
their preceding values, or used parameter vectors obtained during the last iteration (with a
modification of the number of quadrature points and smoothing parameters). Using this strategy,
we usually obtained during simulation the rejection rate less than 3\%. A sensitivity analysis
was conducted without this strategy, and similar results were obtained on the converged samples,
with about a 23\% rejection rate.
