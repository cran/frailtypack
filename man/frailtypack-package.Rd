\title{General Frailty models: shared, joint and nested frailty models with
prediction; Evaluation of Failure-Time Surrogate Endpoints}
\description{
Frailtypack fits several classes of frailty models using a penalized
likelihood estimation on the hazard function but also a parametric
estimation.  1) A shared frailty model and Cox proportional hazard model.
Clustered and recurrent survival times can be studied.  2) Additive frailty
models for proportional hazard models with two correlated random effects
(intercept random effect with random slope).  3) Nested frailty models for
hierarchically clustered data (with 2 levels of clustering) by including two
iid gamma random effects.  4) Joint frailty models in the context of joint
modelling for recurrent events with terminal event for clustered data or
not. A joint frailty model for two semi-competing risks for clustered data
is also proposed.  5) Joint General frailty models in the context of a joint
modelling for recurrent events with terminal event data with two independent
frailty terms.  6) Joint Nested frailty models in the context of joint
modelling for recurrent events with terminal event, for hierarchically
clustered data (with two levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma
random effects.  7) Multivariate joint frailty models for two types of
recurrent events and a terminal event.  8) Joint models for longitudinal
data and a terminal event.  9) Trivariate joint models for longitudinal
data, recurrent events and a terminal event.  Prediction values are
available. Left truncated (not for the joint models), right-censored data,
interval-censored data (only for Cox proportional hazard and shared frailty
model) and strata are allowed. In each model, the random effects have the
gamma or normal distribution. Now, you can also consider time-varying effect
covariates in Cox, shared and joint frailty models. The package includes
concordance measures for Cox proportional hazards models and for shared
frailty models. 10) Joint frailty models for the validation of surrogate 
endpoints in multiple randomized clinical trials with failure-time endpoints. 
This model includes a shared individual-level random effect, a shared trial 
random-effct associated with the hazard risks and a correlated random 
effects-by-trial interaction.
