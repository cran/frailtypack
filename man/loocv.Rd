\title{The trials leave-one-out crossvalidation for the one-step Joint surrogate model for evaluating a 
canditate surrogate endpoint.}
\usage{
loocv(object, unusedtrial, var.used = "error.estim", alpha. = 0.05, 
dec = 3, print.times = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object inheriting from \code{jointSurroPenal} class
(output from calling the function \code{jointSurroPenal} or \code{jointSurroCopPenal}).}

\item{unusedtrial}{A list of trial not to be taken into account in the cross-validation.
This parameter is useful when after excluding some trials, the model is facing 
convergence problem.}

\item{var.used}{This argument takes two values. The first one is \code{"error.estim"}
and indicates if the prediction variance takes into account
the estimation errors from the estimates of the parameters. If estimates 
are supposed to be known or if the dataset includes a high number of trials with 
a high number of subject per trial, value \code{"No.error"} can be used. 
The default is \code{error.estim}.}

\item{alpha.}{The confidence level for the prediction interval. The default is \code{0.05}}

\item{dec}{The desired number of digits after the decimal point for parameters
and confidence intervals. Default of 3 digits is used.}

\item{print.times}{a logical parameter to print estimation time. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
This function returns an object of class \code{jointSurroPenalloocv} containing:
\item{result}{A dataframe 
including for each trial the number of included subjects, the observed 
treatment effect on the surrogate endpoint, the observed treatment effect on
the true endpoint and the predicted treatment effect on the 
true enpoint with the associated prediction intervals. If the observed treatment effect on the true 
endpoint is included into the prediction interval, the last columns contains "*".} 
\item{ntrial}{The number of trials in the meta-analysis}
\item{notconvtrial}{The vector of trials that have not converged}
\item{pred.error}{The prediction error, corresponding to the number of cases where the prediction interval does not included the observed treatment effect on T}
\item{different.models}{The list of the \code{G} models obtained after excuded for the \code{i-th} trial}
\item{loocv.summary}{A dataframe of the estimates for the \code{G} models; each raw including the results
 without the subjects of the given trial}
