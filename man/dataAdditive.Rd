\format{This data frame contains the following columns: \describe{
\item{group}{identification variable} \item{t1}{start of interval (=0,
because left-truncated data are not allowed)} \item{t2}{end of interval
(death or censoring time)} \item{event}{censoring status (0:alive, 1:death,
as acensoring indicator} \item{var1}{dichotomous covariate (=0 or 1,as a
treatment variable)} \item{var2}{dichotomous covariate (=0 or 1,as a
treatment variable)} }}

\description{
This contains simulated samples of 100 clusters with 100 subjects in each
cluster, like a gathering of clinical trials databases. Two correlated
centred gaussian random effects are generated with the same variance fixed
at 0.3 and the covariance at -0.2. The regression coefficient \eqn{\beta} is
fixed at -0.11. The percentage of right-censored data is around 30 percent
which are generated from a uniform distribution on [1,150]. The baseline
hazard function is considered as a simple Weibull.
