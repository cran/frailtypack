\description{
This dataset combines the data  that were collected in four double-blind randomized
clinical trials in advanced ovarian cancer. In these trials, the objective was to 
examine the efficacy of cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin (CP) versus cyclophosphamide 
plus adriamycin plus cisplatin (CAP) to treat advanced ovarian cancer. The candidate 
surrogate endpoint \bold{S} is progression-free survival time, defined as the time (in years)
from randomization to clinical progression of the disease or death. The true endpoint
\bold{T} is survival time, defined as the time (in years) from randomization to death of any 
cause
