\description{
The often used data set for interval-censored data, described and given in
full in Finkelstein and Wolfe (1985). It involves 94 breast cancer patients
who were randomized to either radiation therapy with chemotherapy or
radiation therapy alone. The outcome is time until the onset of breast
retraction which is interval-censored between the last clinic visit before
the event was observed and the first visit when the event was observed.
Patients without breast retraction were right-censored.
